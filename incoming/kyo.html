<p style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><b>"If she looks fine and acts well why's she single?"</b> - asked the man, before realizing the truth behind this jew.</p>

<h2>Act 1: Fangirling</h2>

<p>Our story begins on our <a href="https://discord.gg/tJUxKjYVrx" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: red;">server</a>, where (our main character)
during hearing the voice of the owner of our beautiful server began her fangirling stage.<br>
After putting up all possible questions to my dear friend, she saw the #general. In that exact channel, the talk was about the ex of her target.<br>
She was willing to pay 20 euros just so he doesn't talk more about her. ( dont smile XD )
<br>
<br>
When getting the attention she wished for, she had the opportunity to play with the one she fangirled for.<br>

<h2 style="margin-top: 4rem;">Act 2: The Attempted "Suicide"</h2>

<p>
Everything went right for days, till the target of our main character decided he's going to play with a friend of years.<br>
Our retard took it as a sign that she should look for a man, so she sold herself as a free-use whore on servers.<br>

    Even though this was weird, after days of not talking, she decided that she's going to "kill herself"
